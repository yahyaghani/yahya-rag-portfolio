    description: "I am Yahya,  with 4 years of experience in early-stage tech and the founder of Caddie Ai, an AI-driven product I developed from scratch. My journey through building the app, models, and infrastructure has taught me invaluable lessons in managing technical debt and enhancing product functionality. My expertise extend to creating efficient data pipelines, debugging user interfaces for web and native applications and architecting the early stage scaffolding for Early stage Applications. I eagerly anticipate discussing our shared visions to explore how we can create a dent in this universe.",
